# Chat Application

## A simple chat application using Javascript, React, Flask, Python, and PostgreSQL.

## Summary

This simple chat application is designed to mimic some of the characteristics of Slack or Facebook messenger. A user can access the application only once logged in, otherwise they will be redirected back to the login page. The back end uses psycopg2 and SQLAlchemy to create new entries into a database, as well as render those entries to the chatroom. The chatroom log is permanently maintained with each user session, and can be viewed fully once logged in. The front end UI is intentionally minimalistic, in order to focus primarily on back-end functionality.
